## Login module
* [login-module](https://github.com/France-ioi/login-module)
This module takes care of the authentication of users into our different platforms. Different authentication methods are supported: plain login/password, google, facebook, authentication through LTI, SAML (in progress), and some custom authentication from other platforms such as PMS.
* [lti-to-bebras](https://github.com/France-ioi/lti-to-bebras)
This module is used here as a way to authenticate to the login-module through the LTI standard. It is also used to directly integrate tasks into platforms that support LTI (see below).


## Algorea learning platform
* [AlgoreaPlatform](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaPlatform)
This is the main repository for our new exercise platform. The goal is for this platform to eventually replace our other platforms, once all the required features are in place. A beta version can be tested on http://parcours.algorea.org
It uses:
 * [commonFramework](https://github.com/France-ioi/commonFramework) at its heart for client/server synchronization
 * [login-module](https://github.com/France-ioi/login-module) for authentication
 * [pem-platform](https://github.com/France-ioi/pem-platform) to integrate tasks through the task API

## Bebras contest platform
* [bebras-platform](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-platform)
This platform is specialized in organizing large scale contests that make use of client-side only interactive tasks. It uses tasks that implement the task integration API as well as the installation API.
It uses:
 * [commonFramework](https://github.com/France-ioi/commonFramework) for client/server synchronization
 * ...

Production versions of the contest side of this platform are available here (among other places):
 * [concours.castor-informatique.fr](http://concours.castor-informatique.fr)
 * [epreuve.concours-alkindi.fr](http://epreuve.concours-alkindi.fr)

## Alkindi contest platform
This platform is used to run the rounds 2 and up of the Alkindi cryptography contest. Students that are qualified can log in, create or join teams, access to the current round of tasks and collaborate to solve them.
* [alkindi-frontend](https://github.com/France-ioi/alkindi-frontend)
* [alkindi-backend](https://github.com/France-ioi/alkindi-backend)

## Alkindi tasks
Tasks for the Alkindi platform are developed separately, but do not use the task API yet. They can mostly be tested independently of the platform, but are not yet ready to be integrated in other platforms.

## Codecast learning tool
The codecast project is a C language interpreter and debugger that runs in the browser, except for the parsing stage which is done on the server using clang. The tool is designed as an educational tool. Teachers can record a session where they speak while using the tool to demonstrate the execution of C code to teach a new concept. The recording can then be played by students that can interrupt it at any time to take over and play with the debugger.
It can be tested on [codecast.france-ioi.org](https://codecast.france-ioi.org), try the examples in the top-right corner.
* [codecast](https://github.com/France-ioi/codecast): recording/replaying events and voice
* [persistent-c](https://github.com/France-ioi/persistent-c): C interpreter in the browser
* [c-to-json](https://github.com/France-ioi/c-to-json): uses clang to parse C and send a json AST to the client

## Monitoring tools
