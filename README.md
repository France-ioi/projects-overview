* [Castor-informatique.fr](https://github.com/France-ioi/Castor-informatique.fr) : Corresponds to http://castor-informatique.fr

## Login module:
* [login-module](https://github.com/France-ioi/login-module)
This module takes care of the authentication of users into our different platforms. Different authentication methods are supported: plain login/password, google, facebook, authentication through LTI, SAML (in progress), and some custom authentication from other platforms such as PMS.

## Algorea learning platform
* [AlgoreaPlatform](https://github.com/France-ioi/AlgoreaPlatform)
This is the main repository for our new exercise platform. The goal is for this platform to eventually replace our other platforms, once all the required features are in place.
A beta version can be tested on http://parcours.algorea.org
It uses:
 * [common-framework](https://github.com/France-ioi/common-framework) at its heart for client/server synchronization
 * [login-module](https://github.com/France-ioi/login-module) for authentication
 * [pem-platform](https://github.com/France-ioi/pem-platform) to integrate tasks through the task API

## Bebras contest platform
* [bebras-platform](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-platform)
This platform is specialized in organizing large scale contests that make use of client-side only interactive tasks. It uses tasks that implement the task integration API as well as the installation API.
It uses:
 * [common-framework](https://github.com/France-ioi/common-framework) for client/server synchronization
...

Production versions of the contest side of this platform are available here (among other places):
[concours.castor-informatique.fr](http://concours.castor-informatique.fr)
[epreuve.concours-alkindi.fr](http://epreuve.concours-alkindi.fr)

## Alkindi contest platform
This platform is used to run the rounds 2 and up of the Alkindi cryptography contest. Students that are qualified can log in, create or join teams, access to the current round of tasks and collaborate to solve them.

## Codecast learning tool
The codecast project is a C language interpreter and debugger that runs in the browser, except for the parsing stage which is done on the server using clang. The tool is designed as an educational tool. Teachers can record a session where they speak while using the tool to demonstrate the execution of C code to teach a new concept. The recording can then be played by students that can interrupt it at any time to take over and play with the debugger.
It can be tested on [codecast.france-ioi.org](codecast.france-ioi.org), try the examples in the top-right corner.

## Monitoring tools
* [bebras-monitor](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-monitor)
This tool is used to monitor connexions to a platform, show statistics about the different ips that connect to it, and give the possibility to whitelist or blacklist some ips. This helps to protect against some types of DDOS attacks.

## Task integration API:
This API’s purpose is to make it easy to integrate a given task in different platforms, and for platforms to use tasks from all types of sources. The API is [documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMca_fGNyLtSPjsTuIv2owcnNt2lH4iHkZ1pTURIL6A/edit?usp=sharing)
* [pem-task](https://github.com/France-ioi/pem-task)
Scripts that are part of the task-side of the task integration API.
* [pem-platform](https://github.com/France-ioi/pem-platform)
Scripts that are part of the platform-side of the task integration API
* [pem-task-validator](https://github.com/France-ioi/pem-task-validator)
A tool to validate that tasks and platforms conform to the Task integration API.
It also provides a way to check that grading works as expected.
* [fioi-task-importer](https://github.com/France-ioi/fioi-task-importer)
A tool to import tasks from svn:
 * For server evaluated tasks, import their content into a mysql database of tasks, to be used by TaskPlatform
 * For pure client tasks (bebras-based) or presentation, simply place the files on a server. (This is temporary)
* [lti-to-bebras](https://github.com/France-ioi/lti-to-bebras)
Wrapper to present tasks that conform to our Integration API, as LTI-compliant tasks.

## Server-evaluated programming tasks
This set of tools is used to offer programming tasks, where the solutions of the students are sent to servers to be graded.
* [TaskPlatform](https://github.com/France-ioi/TaskPlatform)
This is the main interface that hosts programming tasks, and is the user-facing entry points of programming tasks.
* [fioi-editor2](https://github.com/France-ioi/fioi-editor2)
This is the ace-based multi-file editor used by TaskPlatform to let the user edit different solutions in different languages, as well as different test cases. Also integrates a Blockly editor.
* [submission-manager](https://github.com/France-ioi/submission-manager)
This is an interface that presents the results of the grading of a submission. It is intended to be integrated in the TaskPlatform interface, or any similar interface.
* [graderqueue](https://github.com/France-ioi/graderqueue)
Submissions from students are sent to this queue, and different servers connect to that queue to obtain their next submission to grade. The repository also includes graderserver, which fetches tasks from this queue and sends them for evaluation to taskgrader.
* [taskgrader](https://github.com/France-ioi/taskgrader)
This is the tool that actually grades a submission, running it within a sandbox (isolate), on a list of specified test cases, etc. The repository includes lots of tools to create, test and submit tasks.

## Tasks libraries:
* [bebras-modules](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-modules)
This repository contains all types of libraries that are used to create various interactive tasks. Each library should probably have its own repository, but we want non-developers to be able to install everything just with an svn checkout of a private repository where we work on future contest tasks.
* [fioi-blockly](https://github.com/France-ioi/fioi-blockly)
Modifications to Blockly, overriding and adding some blocks to Blockly; meant to be included after Blockly. Modifications include:

## Bebras review
* [bebras-review](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-review)
This tool is intended to help members of the Bebras community to review tasks that are created by many countries each year, and help them select a subset of tasks for their contest.

## Synchronization framework
* [common-framework](https://github.com/France-ioi/common-framework)
This repository contrains a few tools that are shared by several platforms. The main one is the synchronization framework, which takes care of synchronizing a subset of a mysql database with as small client-side database.
